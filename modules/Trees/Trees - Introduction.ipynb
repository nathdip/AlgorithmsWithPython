    "- A tree data structure has a root, branches and leaves.\n",
    "- All children of one node are independent of the children of another node.\n",
    "- Each leaf node is unique\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "    - Folder structure in our computer\n",
    "    - Webpage, tree correspond to html tags\n",

    "#### Node\n",
    "- A node is a fundamental part of a tree, it can have a name, which we call the 'key'.\n",
    "- A node may also have additional information, we call this payload\n",
    "- Payload information may not be central to may tree algorithms, it is often critical in applications that make use of trees\n",

    "- An edge is a fundamental part of the tree.\n",
    "- Edge the nodes of the tree and also defines the hierarchy\n",
    "- A PATH is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges."
